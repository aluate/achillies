# Push to YOUR GitHub Account

I'll help you push the Corporate Crashout code to YOUR GitHub account so you can deploy from there.

## What I Need

**Your GitHub username** - I'll create a repo called `CorporateCrashoutTrading` on your account.

## Two Options

### Option 1: You Create the Repo (I Push to It)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `CorporateCrashoutTrading`
3. Choose Public or Private
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Then tell me your GitHub username and I'll push the code

### Option 2: I Create the Repo via GitHub API

If you have a GitHub Personal Access Token, I can create the repo automatically and push the code.

## After I Push

You'll have:
- Your own repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CorporateCrashoutTrading`
- All the code pushed
- Ready to deploy to Vercel from YOUR account

## Tell Me Your GitHub Username

Just reply with your GitHub username and I'll:
1. Check if the repo exists (if not, guide you to create it)
2. Push all the Corporate Crashout code to it
3. Then you can deploy to Vercel from your own repo!
