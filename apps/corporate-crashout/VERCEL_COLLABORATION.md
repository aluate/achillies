# Vercel Collaboration - Do You Need Pro?

## Short Answer: **NO, you don't need Vercel Pro!**

## Free Tier Collaboration

### Option 1: GitHub Collaboration (Recommended - FREE)
**What you need:**
- GitHub account (free)
- Justin adds you as collaborator on the GitHub repo (free)
- You can then import the repo to Vercel (free)

**No Vercel Pro needed** - this is all free!

### Option 2: Vercel Project Collaboration (Also FREE for basic use)
**What you need:**
- Justin creates the Vercel project
- Justin adds you as a team member (available on free tier)
- You can help manage deployments

**Free tier allows:**
- Adding team members
- Collaborating on deployments
- Managing environment variables together

## When You MIGHT Need Pro

**Vercel Pro trial is only needed for:**
- Advanced team features (like audit logs, more team members)
- Higher deployment limits
- Better performance monitoring

**For basic deployment collaboration, FREE tier works perfectly!**

## Simplest Path (No Pro Needed)

1. **Justin adds you to GitHub repo** (free, takes 30 seconds)
   - Justin: Settings → Collaborators → Add you
   - You accept invitation
   - Done!

2. **Either of you can deploy to Vercel** (free)
   - Go to vercel.com/new
   - Import the repo
   - Deploy!

3. **If Justin already created the Vercel project:**
   - He can add you as team member (free tier supports this)
   - Or you can create your own Vercel project pointing to the same repo

## Recommended Approach

**Best option:** Justin adds you as GitHub collaborator (completely free):
- You get access to the code
- Either of you can deploy to Vercel
- Changes sync automatically
- No Pro subscription needed

## What Justin Needs to Do (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/elikjwilliams/CorporateCrashoutTrading/settings/access
2. Click "Add people" or "Invite a collaborator"
3. Type your GitHub username
4. Give "Write" access
5. Click "Add"

That's it! Then you can:
- See the repo
- Import it to Vercel
- Deploy it

**No Pro trial, no payment, completely free!**

**TL;DR:** GitHub collaboration is free. Vercel deployment is free. You only need Pro for advanced team features. For what you're doing, free tier is perfect!
